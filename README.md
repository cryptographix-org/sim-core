## Building The Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
4. To build the code, you can now run:

  ```shell
  gulp build
  ```
5. You will find the compiled code in the `dist` folder, available in three module formats: AMD, CommonJS and ES6.
